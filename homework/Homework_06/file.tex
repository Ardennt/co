        for sw \$t4, 20(\$t5): the path begins at PC, then passes through the adder PC + 4, then to the branch mux, then goes back to PC. New PC address ends up being \boxed{PC + 4}

    "Register read" is the time needed after the rising clock edge for the new register value to appear on the output. This value applies to the PC only. "Register setup" is the amount of time a register's data input must be stable before the rising edge of the clock. This value applies to both the PC and Register File.

    \textbf{Problem 12.14.10} When the processor designers consider a possible improvement to the processor datapath, the decision usually depends on the cost/performance trade-off. In the following three problems, assume that we are beginning with the datapath from COD figure 4.21, the latencies from Exercise 4.7, and the following costs:

    \noindent Suppose doubling the number of general purpose registers from 32 to 64 would reduce the number of lw and sw instruction by 12\%, but increase the latency of the register file from 150 ps to 160 ps and double the cost from 200 to 400. (Use the instruction mix from Exercise 4.8 and ignore the other effects on the ISA discussed in Exercise 2.18.)

        \item \textbf{What is the speedup achieved by adding this improvement?}
        \\ hi
        \item \textbf{Compare the change in performance to the change in cost.}
        \item \textbf{Given the cost/performance ratios you just calculated, describe a situation where it makes sense to add more registers and describe a situation where it doesn't make sense to add more registers.}
