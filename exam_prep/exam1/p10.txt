10) Within a Unix-like command line environment, we have a directory 
that contains multiple text files with a ".txt" extension. We wish 
to pass the contents of all of these files directory directly into 
program "cool_parser" via stdin. Unfortunately, we don't have the 
source code for cool_parse and can't modify it. It doesn't matter 
in which order we pass the file contents to the parse. How can we 
accomplish our wishes in a single command?

cool_parse < *.txt
