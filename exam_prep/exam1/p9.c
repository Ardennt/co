
// 9) Write a function mem_dump() that dumps the contents of memory to stdout. 
// mem_dump() should take the starting memory address to dump and the number 
// of bytes to dump. The output of mem_dump() should be similar to the output 
// of "hexdump -C" command. Then define char*** arr, allocate memory for all 
// elements of this two-dimensional array of C-strings, initialize all elements 
// with C-string literals (i.e., literal C-strings like "CompOrg rulezzz!"), 
// and determine all memory locations that are related to this array. Use 
// your mem_dump() to print those memory locations and verify that they 
// indeed contain data (characters and pointers) of your array.
