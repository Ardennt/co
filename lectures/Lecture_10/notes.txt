Lecture 10 - September 29, 2022

Plan for today
+ Homework 3
  - Get started ASAP
    * You must keep the filename as hw03.s
+ HW 2 solution
  - Main takeaway from HW1 and HW2:
    * Be careful with memory management - always use valgrind and/or Dr. Memory
    * Submitty is not broken (one would hope!), your code is
+ Test 3
  - Next Monday
  - Content:
    * Entire Chapter 0 (C language and all Unix stuff)
    * Entire Chapter 1 (measuring performance, Amdahl's Law, etc.)
    * No MIPS on Test 1
  - See posted practice problems. Solutions will be posted over the weekend
+ Slides
  - More branching logic, calling functions and the stack
  - dub_loop.s, lotta_arg.s, leaf.s, logical-ops.s, loop.s, array.s
