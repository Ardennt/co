Lecture 18 - November 3, 2022

Plan for today
+ Grading
  - HW 4 underway
+ Test 2
  - Practice problems
    * practice02.txt
+ HW 5
  - Released
  - Start early (which means yesterday or even earlier!)
    * Lots of coding
    * More time consuming than you might think
    * Debug locally so that by the time Submitty submission page opens, you have everything ready.
    * DO NOT attempt to use Submitty as a debugging tool. The number of submission attempts will be limited, as usual.
+ Slides
  - Finish with Chapter 3/Appendix B
  - Start on MIPS processor design (Chapter 4)
