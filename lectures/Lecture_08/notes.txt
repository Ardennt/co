Getting QtSpim to run in WSL2:
Do all this:  https://cs233.github.io/oyom_wsl2_setup.html
Go to:        https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/
Download:     qtspim_9.1.22_linux64.deb
sudo apt-get install qt5-default
sudo dpkg -i qtspim_9.1.22_linux64.deb
qtspim

If it doesn't work, then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

However, spim is also available natively via apt-get
apt-get install spim
spim

This is command line only, so you'll need to look up commands, etc. to use it
